# Lab 03: Resource Manager Locks
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario 

You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how resource locks can be used to prevent accidental deletion or changes. Specifically, you need to:

- create a ReadOnly lock

- create a Delete lock
 
## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Resource Manager Locks

### Exercise 1: Resource Manager Locks

#### Estimated timing: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a storage account.
- Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account. 
- Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock. 
- Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock.
- Task 5: Test the Delete lock.

#### Task 1: Create a storage account.

In this task, you will create a storage account for the lab.

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.


1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

	>**Note**: It might take about a minute for the Cloud Shell pane to show up.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a storage account in the newly created resource group:
    
    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName AZ500LAB03 -Name <storageAccountName> -Location  EastUS -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2 
    ```
   
   >**Note**: In the above code snippet, replace the **<>** name placeholder with the storage account name, **strgacc<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false" />**
   
   >**Note**:  Wait until the storage account is created. This might take a couple of minutes. 

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account. 

In this task, you will add a read-only lock to the storage account. This will protect the resource from accidental deletion or modification. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Resource groups** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **AZ500LAB03** resource group entry.

1. On the **AZ500LAB03** resource group blade, in the list of resources, **select the new storage account**. 

1. Under the **Settings** section in the left navigation pane, click on the "Locks" icon.

1. Click on **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**ReadOnly Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Read-only**|

1. Click on **OK**. 

   >**Note**:  The storage account is now protected from accidental deletion and modification.

#### Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click on **Configuration**.

1. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click on **Save**.

1. You should be able to spot a notification stating **Failed to update storage account**.

1. Click on the **Notifications** icon in the toolbar at the top of the Azure portal and review the notification, which will resemble the following text: 

	> **"Failed to update storage account 'xxxxxxxx'. Error: The scope 'xxxxxxxx' cannot perform write operation because following scope(s) are locked: '/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/AZ500LAB03/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxxx'. Please remove the lock and try again"**

1. Return the **Configuration** blade of the storage account and click on **Discard**. 

1. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click on **Delete**.

1. On the **Delete storage account** blade, we notice that the delete button is disabled with the following warning sign :

	>**'storage-acc-name' can't be deleted because this resource or its parent has a lock. Locks must be removed before this resource can be deleted.**
	
   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a ReadOnly lock will stop accidental deletion and modification of a resource.

#### Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock.

In this task, you remove the ReadOnly lock from the storage account and create a Delete lock. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying properties of the newly created storage account.

1. In the **Settings** section, select **Locks**.  

1. On the **Locks** blade, click on the **Delete** icon on the far right of the **ReadOnly Lock** entry.

1. Click on **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**Delete Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Delete**|

1. Click on **OK**. 

#### Task 5: Test the Delete lock.

In this task, you will test the Delete lock. You should be able to modify the storage account, but not delete it. 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click on **Configuration**.

2. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click on **Save**.

   >**Note**:  This time, the change should be successful.

3. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click on **Delete**.

4. On the **Delete storage account** blade, we notice that the delete button is disabled with the following warning sign :

	>**'storage-acc-name' can't be deleted because this resource or its parent has a delete lock. Locks must be removed before this resource can be deleted.**

   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a **Delete** lock will allow configuration changes but stop accidental deletion.

   >**Note**:  By using Resource Locks you can implement an extra line of defense against accidental or malicious changes and/or deletion of the most important resources. Resource locks can be removed by any user with the **Owner** role, but doing so requires a conscious effort. Locks supplement Role Based Access Control. 



5. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying properties of the newly created storage account.

6. In the **Settings** section, select **Locks**.  

7. On the **Locks** blade, click on the **Delete** icon on the far right of the **Delete Lock** entry.

   > **Results:** In this exercise, you learned to use Resource Manager locks to protect resources from modification and accidental deletion.
